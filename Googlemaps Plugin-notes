Short code builder:
Takes user input address (selections availabel address options using api call), other atributes & renders a preview map to the user. The user accepts the preview and the parms are output as a shortcode. If the user has custom data it's passed between the.



Shortcode php
------
Test for JS
test if shortcode is loaded on the page, if so encue google
- we could peak ahead and load css conditionally too but this means filtering the output prior which will slow us down. Since is such a minor tweak, we'll just return the <style> via add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'tr_gmaps_header' );

-- On second thought the google api needs to be loaded before the plugin, so we cant be dding it to the footer (or can we?)

we can  use wp_enqueue_script() in the shortcode function and it will be added to the footer

	CSS still requres a peak ahead method in order to be added to head
	Problems with peakahead
		- it overlooks do_shortcode in templates
		- costs as it passes ovder the content another time

			-- is do_shortcode a use case? MAYBE/YES PROBABLY: events template

	TIPS:
		// Will search the template files too

		// Shows both peak ahead and set flag methods

-Peak ahead method
	preg_match( '#\[ *shortcode([^\]])*\]#i', $content );

	use the layout of below:

-------
- Give the map a unique id
-------
If the shortcode isn't pre-populated with information (from the builder)
	- create default short code atributes from api
-------
- Test if shortcode is built with builder
- If it has been updated marker data changes?

-- How do we do the search so that we update info on marker?
-- How do we choose which address is used if mutiple are returned?

- Conditionally deal with all the atributes
- Handel content added to the tag inbetween the shortcode
